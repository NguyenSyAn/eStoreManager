I use any code plugin to generate code from class diagram. We have to write the template file for generating codes.

* [automatically generated codes](https://bitbucket.org/vietanhdev/isd.ict.20181-01/src/master/DetailedDesign/week-07/generatedCodes/)

* [my own codes](https://bitbucket.org/vietanhdev/isd.ict.20181-01/src/master/Project/eStoreManager-SERVER/)

Compare to my own code:

* The same: The structure of file (class and each package) is the same

* The different: The content is different due to lack of java types in astah UML (Set, String, ...). Moreover, my own codes is more specifically and using Spring Boot framework, while automatically generated codes is based on [java template](https://bitbucket.org/vietanhdev/isd.ict.20181-01/src/master/DetailedDesign/week-07/template/).
